INTRODUCTION                        *bullet-journal*

A simple Vim plugin offering some journaling capabilities. Based on the idea
of plain text journaling by Akshay (https://peppe.rs/posts/plain_text_journaling/).

KEYBINDINGS                         *bullet-journal-keybindings*

<C-i>           Insert a new note at the very top of the file.
<S-h>           Rotate the list item type backward.
<S-l>           Rotate the list item type forward.


ABBREVIATIONS                       *bullet-journal-abbreviations*

Since some of the list types are decorated using non-typable characters, the
plugin configured some abbreviations expanding at the begginning of a line.

    Abbreviation            Expansion
    "todo"                  "·"
    "done"                  "×"
    "event"                 "o"
    "note"                  "-"
    "moved"                 ">"


FORMATTING                          *bullet-journal-formatting*

The plugin configures the |formatprg| and |equalprg| so you can use either the
{gqip} or {==} over a selection to sort the items on the list. Sorting is
done using the version sort (-V) algorithm from GNU sort utility.
