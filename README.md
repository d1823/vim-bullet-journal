# README

A very simple journaling plugin. Nothing much besides some syntax highlighting, spellchecking and some basic keybindings
related to moving between different states of the item on the list.

Inspired by Akshay's [Plain Text Journaling](https://peppe.rs/posts/plain_text_journaling/) I read a while ago.
